# Godchat

###From Decisions to Disciples.
Godchat allows crowd sourcing of missionaries. Everyone is a missionary.

###Turn your content into connection opportunities.
The advent of online ministry has blurred traditional structures of discipleship. Viewers simply finding Christian material does not automatically lead to disciples. In todays digital age, we need a platform to bring people from online connection, into community and follow-up based around relationship.

This [Ruby on Rails Application](http://rubyonrails.org/) powers the [GodChat](http://www.godchat.tv) website and API.

This repository consists of:

* The web site, including engine accounts, operator accounts, client account and more
* The Browse pages - a web front-end to the Godchat Platform

A fully-functional Rails installation depends on other services that are provided by other software. The default installation uses publically visible and freely available services to help with development and testing.
