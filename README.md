# Godchat

This is The Rails Port, the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
application that powers the [GodChat](http://www.godchat.tv) website and API.
The software is also known as "godchat".

This repository consists of:

* The web site, including user accounts, diary entries, user-to-user messaging
* The Browse pages - a web front-end to the OpenStreetMap data

A fully-functional Rails Port installation depends on other services, including map tile
servers and geocoding services, that are provided by other software. The default installation
uses publically-available services to help with development and testing.
