        The advent of online ministry has blurred traditional structures of discipleship. Viewers simply finding Christian material does not automatically lead to disciples. In todays digital age, we need a platform to bring people from online connection, into community and follow-up
        <strong>based around relationship.</strong>

          There is a small window where your viewers are open to being challenged
          to connect with the gospel. Godchat primes the viewer that chat is active and ready.
          During their visit Godchat has text typed on screen
          visually inviting the viewer to conversation at the peak of their interest.

          Godchat makes use of important viewer metrics like name, location, IP address,
          Facebook profile and graph info (friends in common with our network).
          This allows us to connect local people with similar interests to discuss faith and growth opportunities.

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>
          Relationship is hands down the key to stimulating and facilitating Christian growth. Godchat makes use of this fact by primarily targeting a visitor"s Christian friends, allowing the user to identify one they know and trust to become part of an active session in a unique environment that has resources on hand and an interactive space to see discussion, reconnection and a plan for growth presented.
